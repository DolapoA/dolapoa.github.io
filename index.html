										<h1>Bioinformatics & Data Science in the area of Genomics</h1>
										<p>Dolapo Ajayi, BSc MSc. <br>Trainee Clinical Bioinformatics Scientist @ The Royal Marsden Hospital</p>
									</header>
									<p>Hello there, I currently work as a <b>Bioinformatics Scientist</b> in clinical cancer genomics. I've been training to become a registered Clinical Bioinformatician in the United Kingdom via the <b>Scientist Training Programme</b> (STP). 
										I take particular interest in using <b>Data science</b> methods to understand, diagnose and prognose cancer pathology. My current research is about the detection of <b>Homologous Recombination Deficiency</b> (HRD)
										in Ovarian Cancer patients using genomic sample data. In this work and beyond, I explore the utility of Non-classical statistical methods like <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Bayesian Analysis through experimentation.</b></p>

And all of course with appropriate security groups. I'm getting more acquainted with the various features of Terraform for setting up infrastructure.

										<h2> Join me on my tropospheric journey... err, I mean CLOUD JOURNEY</h2>
										<p> <b>09/03/2025</b> - I've suddenly been struck with a great interest in <b>cloud technology</b>. Over the course of my career so far as a bioinformatician I've picked up knowledge like networking and how the internet works as well as skills in IT like using command line in <b>Linux</b>, coding in <b>Bash, Python or R, using version control and CI/CD</b>. Many of these skills are readily applicable to cloud technology, and they're being required in my work place and in my field in general. I've taken it upon myself to master AWS Cloud services and to be able architect solutions as well as provision solutions using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with a particular focus here on <b>mastering Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL) Terraform</b>. My goal to be able to build cloud solutions with great emphasis on security to implement zero trust architecture whereby every individual or device that interacts with my system is subjected to authentication and verification to ensure that only those permitted have access to the data in the system. </br><b>You can check out my IaC projects here: <a href="https://github.com/DolapoA/cloud_projects.git"> https://github.com/DolapoA/cloud_projects.git </a> </b> I'll be constrcuting some absolutely epic architectures! </p>

										<h2> AWS Public Sector Day 2025</h2>
										<p> <b>27/02/2025</b> - This conference is definitely going to be a staple conference to attend as a bioinformatician or IT/Tech professional working in the public sector. Cloud solutions are more and more necessary as the sheer amount of data being churned out in bioinformatics increases. Short read technology like Illumina's latest sequencer, NovaSeqX and third generation long read sequencing technology like Oxford Nanopore, mean that cloud becomes the go to IT solution for analysing these large datasets and storing it. AWS lead the pack as the biggest cloud service platform constantly advancing the field with new services. As companies and organisations adopt AWS it goes without saying that keeping abreast of best practice in cloud architecture and security becomes a neccessity. </p>

										<h2> A new bioinformatics biomarker for stage 1 lung cancer patients that has prognostic power and which could influence treatment</h2>
										<p> <b>13/01/2025</b> - Another piece of work emerging from the <b>TRACERx</b> (TRAcking Cancer Evolution through therapy/Rx) Clinical Study. This work demonstrates the power of bioinformatics to contribute positively to patient healthcare. <b>ORACLE</b> is the name of the biomarker which has been discovered through extensive bioinformatic analysis and which helps to identify <b>high risk</b> stage 1 lung cancer patients that would otherwise have not been identified as such: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-024-00883-1">Link</a> </p>

										<h2> Interesting findings made about Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)</h2>
										<p> <b>30/12/2024</b> - Recent research in the <b>TRACERx</b> (TRAcking Cancer Evolution through therapy/Rx) Clinical Study has found that a selection of genes, <b>FAT1</b> in particular, are strongly associated with <b>HRD and Chromosomal Instability (CIN)</b>. It will be interesting to know whether this is exclusive to <b>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)</b> or whether it is a Pancancer phenomenon: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-024-01558-w">Link</a> </p>

										<h2> Genomics England Research Summit 2024</h2>
										<p> <b>09/07/2024</b> - A must for anybody working in the field of <b>clinical genomics</b>! By attending <b>you can get a sense of the direction of the field</b>, with England, UK playing a major role as a nation in genomics and biotech, and <b>Genomics England</b> very much an organisation spearheading especially with their pivotal work in the completion of the <b>100K Genome Project</b>. <br>Look out for more events held by Genomics England here: <a href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/events?topic=&type=">Link</a> </p>

										<h2> Starting the Scientist Training Programme September 2022!</h2>
										<p> <b>09/2022</b> - I'm looking forward to the various rotations in the first year like the <b>Genomics of Rare and Heritable Disorders</b> at Great Ormond Street Hospital and <b>Genomic Counselling</b> at Northwick Park, this is a fantastic opportunity to develop as a bioinformatician in clinical genomics. God willing, I'll make the most of it! </p>

										<h2> Insightful article about early career choices for Clinical Scientists</h2>
										<p> <b>30/10/2021</b> - I came across this article detailing results from a <b>survey of Clinical Scientists</b> about the kinds of choices they made early in their career and why. It definitely worth a read for anyone interested in pursuing the STP or anyone already on the programme: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07064-1">Link</a> </p>
